My name is Gabriel A. León ("Gabe") and I am a second year graduate student working in the Neuroendocrinology of Social Ties Lab (NEST) with Dr. Darby Saxbe. In my research, I seek to decipher the emotional and biobehavioral dynamics that sustain close relational bonds. I am especially interested in the propagation of stress within the family system, and possible mechanisms by which family members can regulate each other's psychological and physiological functioning. In general, I approach family science from an *ideographic* perspective – which means I try to capitalize on many different data streams (behavior, biology, neuroimaging, etc.) collected across multiple timescales (seconds, days, years, etc.) to arrive at personalized interventions for diverse populations of families, couples, and children.
